    <desc>Sandtrix is a retro falling sand puzzle game that puts a unique twist on Tetris-style gameplay: When blocks land, they dissolve into sand with realistic physics, filling spaces around them. To clear lines, you must connect the same color of sand from wall to wall across the screen, making it more challenging than traditional block-stacking games. </desc>
