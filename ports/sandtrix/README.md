## Notes

This port has been tested with the Linux version 3.0 files from Itch.io, as well as the 3.0 Demo files and paid version Sandtrix+ files. Please let me (BinaryCounter) know if the game has been updated so I can verify compatibility with the newest version.

The necessary runtimes to run this should be automatically downloaded, but if they aren't, download the `Westonpack 0.2` and `Java jre23.0.2` runtimes on the Portmaster App.

Special thanks to kloptops, cac, Doronimmo, Zehmaluco and Ganimoth for their help in testing and improving this port.

This port uses the new Westonpack runtime and libcrusty to provide X11 compatibility on devices that do not support X11. The runtime is still in active development and somewhat experimental. If you are experiencing issues, please reach out to me on the PM discord server, so i can improve this runtime. Thanks!
